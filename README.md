# Rock_VS_Mine_Machine_learning

## Overview
This system is designed to predict whether an object in the sea is a rock or a mine. It utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, to make these predictions. The data used for training and testing the model was obtained from Kaggle.

## Files
Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for the machine learning system.
Copy_of_sonar_data.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code successfully:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Usage
Ensure that all the required dependencies are installed.
Run the Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb notebook in a compatible environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab).
The notebook will guide you through the following steps:
Importing necessary libraries.
Data collection and processing.
Data exploration and analysis.
Model training using logistic regression.
Model evaluation and accuracy assessment.
Making predictions with the trained model.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to understand each step and execute the code blocks.

## Data

The dataset (Copy_of_sonar_data.csv) contains readings from sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder (simulating a mine) and rocks.
It consists of multiple features (60 in total) representing different aspects of the sonar signals.
Each instance in the dataset is labeled as either 'R' (Rock) or 'M' (Mine).

## Model
The machine learning model utilizes logistic regression, chosen for its suitability for binary classification tasks like predicting rocks or mines.
The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated for accuracy using another portion.
The trained model achieves a certain accuracy on both the training and test data, which is reported in the notebook.


## Predictive System

After training the model, the notebook includes a predictive system where you can input new data (sonar signal readings) to predict whether the object is a rock or a mine.
The system takes an input data array, reshapes it, and uses the trained model to make predictions.
It outputs the predicted label ('R' for rock or 'M' for mine) along with a human-readable interpretation.
